# drop-caches

`drop-caches` is a simple utility to flush the UNIX page cache without superuser privileges.
The program is adapted from https://stackoverflow.com/a/13647032

To generate the executable, simply run `make`.

To invoke the utility, simply run it from the `utils` directory (a symlink will be automatically created when invoking `make`), or run it from this directory).
